## Raspberry Pi HQ Camera

This is a model of the HQ Camera. Original source is from GrabCad (sorry, I don't remember which one) and I made some changes for the 1/4 20 mount on the bottom to match the real camera as much as possible.
All components are separate bodies so the CS adapter and the 1/4 20 mount can be removed if needed.
