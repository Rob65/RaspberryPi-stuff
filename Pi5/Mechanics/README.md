# RaspberryPi 5 Mechanical designs

## RaspberryPi5

This is a copy of the original RaspberryPi5-step from https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/ but with a number of the components colored and in Fusion360 format

## Pi52 ICE Tower RPi5

My model of the Pi52 ICE Tower for the Raspberry Pi 5.
I did not intent to create a perfect model, just a usable one.
This is my original design and seems to be good enough to design cases for this cooler. Feel free to use or modify.
Available both as Fusion360 archive and STEP model.
